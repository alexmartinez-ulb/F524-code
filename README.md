# F524-code
Complete code for the F524 project
There are 4 code snippets: 
- The first notebook named "Code_F524" including the implementation of the different optimization solvers, the benchmarking tools and the different performance plots.
- The other notebooks where used to preprocess the datasets : transforming booleans in integers, string in multiple columns, etc.
- Then there is the raw and processed datasets that are available.

The whole code is designed to run on google colab.
