# F524-code
Complete code for the F524 project
There are 4 code snippets: 
- The first notebook named "Code_F524" including the implementation of the different optimization solvers, the benchmarking tools and the different performance plots.
- The other notebooks where used to preprocess the datasets : transforming booleans in integers, string in multiple columns, etc.
- Then there is the processed datasets that are available, the links to the original datasets are the following:
     - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques (the train set)
     - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
     - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

The whole code is designed to run on google colab. 
To use locally, just replace the paths in the "Code_F524" to fit where you downloaded the preprocessed datasets and delete the 4th cell of "Code_F524"
